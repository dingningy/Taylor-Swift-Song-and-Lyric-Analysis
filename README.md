# Taylor Swift: Song and Lyric Analysis


## :musical_keyboard: Repository Purpose :guitar:
This repository contains the quarto markdown that renders an HTML output, datasets, images, and sources for the mini project titled "Taylor Swift Song and Lyric Analysis" in the course From Data to Manuscript in R. The project includes two parts: 1) Spotify data analysis - Taylor as a brand; 2) Lyric sentiment analysis - Taylor as a person. Specifically, the Spotify data analysis includes descriptive analysis of album average popularity scores and music features with vivid examples. Additionally, this project incorporated casual and correlational analysis to identify factors that contribute to popularity scores, such as track number (the "miserable" track 5 analysis) and music features. For music features' predictions on popularity scores, I employed both descriptive regression (based on history data) and predictive regression (based on training data). Regarding sentiment analysis, I performed t-tests and the Wilcoxon test to examine the differences in track 5's valence scores compared with other track numbers. Sentiment analysis by using the BING lexicon and word cloud visualizations was also applied for this section.
